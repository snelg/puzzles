# Subsets

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-sheep/puzzles-unreleased/master/docs/img/subsets.png)

You are given a grid and a list of sets. Place every set into the grid exactly once. Some sets are given.

1. A horseshoe symbol ⊃ points from a superset to a subset. In other words, the set on the open end must contain every letter in the set on the closed rounded end.
2. All possible horseshoe symbols are given. This means that each set must contain a letter that doesn't appear in the adjacent set, if there is no symbol between them.

This puzzle type was invented by Inaba Naoki under the name *サブセットリンク*, released as a [Java Applet](http://inabapuzzle.com/honkaku/subset.html) with a puzzle generator.

## Controls

Every letter has a fixed position in each set. Left-click a cell to add the letter in that position, or right-click a cell to rule out the letter in that position.

To play with a keyboard, use the arrow keys to move the cursor. Press Enter to place a letter, and press Space to rule out a letter.

## Status

This game is playable. There are currently no difficulty options or alternate grid sizes.
