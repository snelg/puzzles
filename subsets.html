<h1><a name="C55"></a>Chapter 55: <a name="i0"></a>Subsets</h1>
<p>
You are given a grid and a list of sets. Place every set into the grid exactly once. Some sets are given.
</p>
<ol><li>
A horseshoe symbol &#8835; points from a superset to a subset. In other words, the set on the open end must contain every letter in the set on the closed rounded end.
</li>
<li>
All possible horseshoe symbols are given. This means that each set must contain a letter that doesn't appear in the adjacent set, if there is no symbol between them.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
